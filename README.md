# motive-motor - a motivational application 
> front-end repository

This is a motivation application that implements routines I traditionally use on pen and paper into an application. Of course, features to be added like a profile, connections, community boards, etc., are all features that were thought of while brainstorming the transition of these routines to a web applicaiton. Progress tracking, reflections, goals, and habit training were all modeled from routines that I've found to help in my everyday life. 

This project is to solidify and flex the training I completed while attending Thinkful, as well as extent outside my current knowledge and comfort zone with the use of Jest in stead of Mocha/Chai, Frontier instead of Bootstrap, and Netlify instead of Heroku/Vercel. 

React application (create-react-app) created with the help of VScode. Front end implementing end to end testing with jest, and to be created feature by feature following feature branch workflow, and test driven, outside-in development. Front-end styling with Frontier CSS framework. Front-end deployment to netlify.
